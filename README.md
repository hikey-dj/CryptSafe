# CryptSafe
 You have developed a versatile library named cryptsafe that offers functionality to validate digital signatures using SHA-256, RSA, and AES for secure encryption and decryption. This library also includes a command-line tool allowing users to compile and utilize these functions through specific prompts. Additionally, a static Python API has been created to provide a Python interface for users to upload files, making the library accessible for Python developers as well.

# Technical Implementation
  The project leverages the Crypto++ library in C++ for implementing cryptographic algorithms such as SHA-256, RSA, and AES. Additionally, the Python ctypes library is utilized to create a static Python API, enabling a seamless interface for users to interact with the cryptsafe library from Python .
