# CryptSafe
  We have developed a C++ library called cryptsafe that provides robust functions for validating digital signatures using SHA-256 and RSA, along with AES for secure encryption and decryption. Additionally, the library can be used as a tool through command line prompts, offering versatile functionality for various cryptographic needs.
